# SSHBackup
Tool I made to stream line backing up and testing projects and assignments on remote University server.

Packages:
  paramiko - SSH/SFTP client, non-interactive login
  pickle - serialize config objects
  glob - traverse file tree
  
- easily send/get local files and folders to/from remote server via ssh/sftp
- create configs for multiple projects
